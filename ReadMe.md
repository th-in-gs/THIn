## What it is

- Three easy ways to do things later in Cocoa/Cocoa Touch.
- Simpler than `dispatch_after`, `-performSelector:withObject:afterDelay:` and `NSTimer`

## How it works

Three ways! All call back on the main thread/runloop/dispatch queue.

1. A Category on `NSObject` defines a `-thIn:` method that takes an `NSTimeInterval` and returns a proxy object. Methods sent to it will be queued and sent to the original object after the interval elapses. The recently new `instancetype` return type makes this type-safe too! 

    ```ObjC
    [[self thIn:3] doYourThingWithThisArray:@[ @"Everybody", @"to", @"the", @"limit!" ]];
    ```

2. A Category on `NSObject` defines a `-thIn:do:` method that takes an `NSTimeInterval` and a block, and invokes the block after the interval elapses.

    ```ObjC
    [self thIn:3 do:^(id obj) { 
        NSLog(@"The passed in object is the same as self. It's weakly held: %@", obj);
    }];
    ```

3. `THInWeakTimer` is a lightweight timer. It has two main methods. `-invalidate` specifically cancels the timer. The timer is also implicitly cancelled if the `THInWeakTimer` is deallocated.

    ```ObjC
    @interface THInWeakTimer : NSObject
    - (id)initWithDelay:(NSTimeInterval)delay do:(void (^)(void))block;
    - (void)invalidate;
    @end
    ```
    
In the first two cases, the target object is weakly held. This means that if it is released before the interval is up the queued message/block will never be sent/invoked. Why? This is what made sense for my initial use case, and I still haven't found a case where I don't like the behaviour.

## How to use it

I've packaged this as a static library, you should be able to use it as detailed [in this blog post](http://www.blog.montgomerie.net/easy-xcode-static-library-subprojects-and-submodules). It's only a couple of files though, so I won't tell anyone if you just copy them into your project instead.

## Updated by @bendodson

I've deleted the static library leaving just the .h and .m file and added a Podfile instead. Enjoy!
